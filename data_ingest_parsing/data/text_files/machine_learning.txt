Machine Learning Basics
Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following strict, rule-based instructions, machine learning systems use data to identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time. The basic idea is to feed a computer a large amount of data and allow it to “learn” relationships or trends from that data through mathematical models and algorithms.

There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, models are trained using labeled data — for example, teaching a model to recognize cats in photos by providing many examples labeled “cat” or “not cat.” Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, deals with unlabeled data, where the algorithm tries to find hidden patterns or groupings (like clustering customers by behavior). Reinforcement learning involves training an agent through trial and error, where it learns to take actions in an environment to maximize rewards — such as a robot learning to walk or an AI playing a video game.

Machine learning has a wide range of applications in everyday life and industry. It powers technologies like voice assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa), recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix, YouTube), fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and self-driving cars. As data becomes more abundant and computing power increases, machine learning continues to advance rapidly, playing a key role in shaping the future of automation, analytics, and decision-making across many sectors.
